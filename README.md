# **NYC Traffic Collision Analysis: Pre- and Post-COVID Trends**

## Overview
This project analyzes NYC collision data from 2019–2021 to understand how traffic patterns were impacted by the COVID-19 pandemic. The initial hypothesis assumed that collisions would decrease significantly during 2020 lockdowns and return to 2019 levels by 2021. However, the analysis revealed notable deviations from this expectation, providing insight into evolving traffic behavior in the city.

## Data
Source: NYC Open Data – Motor Vehicle Collisions

Years Analyzed: 2019, 2020, 2021

Key Features: Date, location, number of injuries/fatalities, contributing factors

## Methods
Data Cleaning:

Removed null and duplicate values

Standardized date formats and locations

Exploratory Analysis:

Monthly and yearly trends

Borough-level comparisons

Impact of lockdown vs. reopening phases

Statistical Testing:

Compared pre-pandemic and post-pandemic collision rates

Tested hypothesis on collision reduction significance

## Visualization:

Time series plots

Borough-specific heatmaps

Year-over-year percentage changes

## Key Findings

----------------------------------
## Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib)

Jupyter Notebook and VS Code for exploratory analysis
